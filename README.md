## Site Overview

Immerse yourself in your passion for gaming with The Gamer Library, an app meticulously crafted to seamlessly unite your gaming journey across generations and platforms. As a fellow gamer, I embarked on my gaming odyssey from the early days of Sonic 2 on the Sega Mega Drive and have continued the adventure, spanning up to the latest Baldur's Gate III.

As a hardcore gamer, I understand the struggle to keep track of all the games played. In today's digital era, games come in various formats, scattered across different platforms, each maintaining an independent record. This challenge becomes apparent when attempting to reconcile games played on Game Pass with those in the Steam library, or vice versa. Especially with the advent of cloud gaming, titles shuffle in and out of platforms, making it easy to lose track of your gaming history.

Adding a game to The Gamer Library isn't merely about organization; it's about enhancing your gaming satisfaction. There's a unique sense of achievement in conquering the final boss and proudly adding your triumph to the library. Furthermore, it takes the user on a nostalgic journey, linking specific games to significant moments in their life. I vividly recall playing Digimon World 3 on PS1 when my sister was born, conquering Ornstein and Smough in Dark Souls during my Master's degree, exploring the City of Tears in Hollow Knight with my first job, and immersing myself in Baldur's Gate III builds while crafting this very project.

But why limit this experience to personal reminiscence? The Gamer Library goes beyond, allowing you to share and connect with friends. Discover what games your friends are playing and unveil shared affinities, transforming your gaming endeavor into a social adventure.

The Gamer Library isn't just a solo venture; it's a platform for building communities, especially for multiplayer games. Often, the hesitation to delve into multiplayer experiences arises from not having a group to play with. With The Gamer Library, you can find like-minded individuals, creating communities that evolve multiplayer gaming from a solitary pursuit into a shared, social adventure.

Embark on a new chapter of gaming with The Gamer Library — where your gaming history is celebrated, connections are forged, and communities thrive. Join The Gamer Library and redefine the way you experience and share your love for gaming!

## Planning phase

### **Strategy plane**

he Gamer Library, a dynamic web app, distinguishes itself by providing a culturally rich and relevant gaming experience. Users can intuitively track and catalog their gaming journey through a web app interface designed for modern gamers. What sets The Gamer Library apart is the fusion of intuitive tracking features and a user-friendly web app interface, offering more than a traditional game library; it provides a comprehensive gaming experience.

Tech considerations encompass responsive design, integration capabilities with various gaming platforms, and a robust backend infrastructure for scalability. Its technology aligns seamlessly with the preferences of modern gamers accustomed to web apps.

Users engage with the platform not just for organization but to enhance and cherish their gaming lifestyle. Beyond tracking games, it offers a space where users can connect, share, and immerse themselves in the vast world of gaming.

Through competitor analysis, gaps and opportunities have been identified, with a focus not only on competition but on excellence. Many existing libraries only consider games purchased on their specific services. For example, on Steam, you can only track games from Steam, and the same applies to Game Pass. Furthermore, when a title leaves the Game Pass service, you lose track of it entirely.

The primary audience is the diverse gaming community — gamers of all ages, backgrounds, and interests. The platform aims to be the nexus connecting gamers worldwide, providing a space that transcends boundaries and resonates with varied gaming interests. It is especially useful for aged gamers who played on old consoles, where games are challenging to retrieve and catalog, as well as for gamers using a variety of platforms seeking a single place to track all their games.

In a landscape filled with competitors, The Gamer Library distinguishes itself by offering a holistic experience that goes beyond being a repository of games, making it a unique and indispensable part of the gaming landscape.
